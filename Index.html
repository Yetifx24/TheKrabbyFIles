    <p> A website dedicated to researching and documenting the strange occurrences beneath bikini atolls. A small population of mutated fish has made their own civilization on the ocean floor. If the prospect of an underwater fish city wasn't already weird, it seems they have their own crazy events that occur. We are here to discover those events and reveal them to the public. There are a lot of strange occurrences that go on here and we are here to learn more. Join us in our investigation into the secrets that this place holds. </p>
