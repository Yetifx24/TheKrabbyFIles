    <h1> Here is a compelation of some theories we have gathered on some of the biggest mysteries. </h1>

    <h3> The fish here are mutated due to the nuclear tests that were done here </h3>
    <p> In the 1940s - 1950s, there were a series of nuclear tests on this exact location. Bikini Atoll is very radioactive and the radiation could be the reason for the existence of the highly intellegent fish. They must have mutated.</p>

    <h3> Mr. Krabs killed Pearls mother </h3>
    <p>It was quite the shock to see the crab and whale were related. We assumed that the daughter was simply adopted which still could be the case, but after learning more about Mr. Krabs, there could be a darker side to the story. We learned that there was a war a long time ago that Mr. Krabs took part of. He was in the navy. When investigating his home we found many pictures and items tied to his time in the war. Some pictures depict a giant whale. He also has many large spears meant for large fish. It is quite odd. Must investigate further. </p>

    <h3> The Krabby Patties and every other meat is fish </h3>
    <p> The idea of cannibalism is quite obsurd at first, but think about it. Where do they get the meat for the patties? They could be vegan as told to us by an anonymous source, but we know selling fish to others isn't illegal due to Plankton selling Chum and not being shut down. The question is, where does he get the fish from? </p>

    <h3> King neptune is the reason why all the fish are evolved </h3>
    <p> There is a strange Phenomenon that occurs every 100 years in Bikini Bottom. A green moon appears and reverts all the fish back to their primative selves. A french man in an old deep sea diving suit told up that it is called the Neptune moon. With that name, the connections were clear. If Neptune has the power to turn fish into their primal state, and evovled fish into humans, who's to say he wouldn't turn normal fish into smarter, more human like, creatures that would worship him as a god. </p>
