       <h1> The city-state of Bikini Bottom is full of interesting locations. There are three main parts to Bikini Bottom that we saw. We also decided to look into some of the homes and popular locations. </h1>

       <h3> Bikini Bottom </h3>
       <p> Located in the pacific ocean beneath Bikini Atoll. There is a city-state called Bikini Bottom. Bikini Bottom is the primary setting for the show. The population is a mystery as it ranges from five hundred to in the millions. The city is one of three major areas of Bikini Bottom. </p>

       <h3> Goo Lagoon </h3>
       <p> Goo Lagoon is the only beach in Bikini Bottom. It is a brine pool and is a popular place to go for some fun under the sun. There's something hidden beneath the waters. It is potentially too dangerous to researsh at the moement. </p>

       <h3> Jellyfish fields </h3>
       <p> These are the grasslands of Bikini Bottom. Many species of jellfyfish call this place home. It's also the only place in Bikini Bottom where the floor is primarly grass instead of sand. Besides the jellyfish, there isn't much to do there. No further investigation needed. </p>

       <h3> The Krusty Krab </h3>
       <p> The Krusty Krab is the most popular restaurant in Bilini Bpttom, due to its exclusive access to Krabby Patties. It is owned and managed by Mr. Krabs with Squidward and Spongebob being its only employees. It's popularity due to its famous burger has got me wondering what is in those things. Must investigate further.
        </p>

       <h3> The Chum Bucket </h3>
       <p> The polar opposite of the Krusty Krab. The Chum Bucket is the least popular restuarant with getting little to no customers. This is mainly due to the food they are selling, chum. Chum is a mystery and tastes awful. It's no wonder why it's the least popular reastaurant in Bikini Bottom. It's also the home and laboratory of Plankton. </p>

       <h3> Spongebob's House </h3>
       <p> SpongeBob's house is a pineapple under the sea. It is suprisingly big for a pineapple as it has its own library stocked full of books. I wonder how he managed to get everything with a frycooks salary?</p>

       <h3> Patricks House </h3>
       <p> Patrick lives under a rock. His home is furnished but everything is made of sand. Nothing more to learn from there </p>

       <h3> Squidwards House </h3>
       <p> His home is a Maoi. It makes me wonder how it got here. It's farely normal all things considered but the fact that its here in the first place is odd. There seems to be a whole community of octopi that have similar homes. </p>
