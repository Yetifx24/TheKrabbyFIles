    <p> Squidward Tentacles is a turquoise octopus that lives in a Moai (Easter Island Head). He is always in a sour mood in part due to his very annoying neighbors, Spongebob and Patrick. He is always very grumpy and seems to not enjoy life. He also has many hobbies like playing the clarinet and painting but seems to suck at it. He is the only cashier at the Krusty Krab. </p>
